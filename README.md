# About Syncplay Android:

If you're here, you probably know what Syncplay does. In short, you and your friends enter one
virtual room created by Syncplay, each one of you loads the same video file, and Ta-Dah,
synchronized playback !

Syncplay on Android does exactly the same thing, and it also provides you with the same Chat
functionality that Syncplay has on PC. For now, a lot of features are missing but be patient as I
port everything to Android.

Big thanks to the creators for making the software open-source and maintaining a variety of servers
in order to let the people have fun. (Official Syncplay can be found here: https://syncplay.pl/)

# How it works

The official Desktop Syncplay relies on external players and callbacks in order to get it working.
However, there is no need for such hurdle on Android, since the Android client comes with an
integrated player.

# How to use it with your friends:

1- Download the latest release, and install it (Supports Android 5.0 Lollipop up to 13 Tiramisu)
2- Open Syncplay Android. 3- Choose any username you like. 4- You and your friends should agree on
one room name. 5- You guys should also make sure you're choosing the same server. 6- Click JOIN Room
and Ta-Dah, you're all in the same room ready to watch together.

# Suggestions/Bugs :

Please let me know if there is anything going slightly wrong with the APK. As far as I am concerned,
it works like a charm on my end.
